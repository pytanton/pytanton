##üëã Hey, folks! 
![FE developer](https://github.com/pytanton/pytanton/assets/135310921/6e3cd71c-6189-49b9-b0e0-2da3c08e3c65)
I'm Anton, your friendly neighborhood Pythonista who loves coding more than morning coffee (and that's saying something!)

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub where I'm on a mission to simplify life one line of code at a time. Whether it's crafting Django magic, unleashing the power of FastAPI or making Flask dance to my tune, I've got you covered. Take a peek into my repos and if you find something that resonates with you, let's connect or perhaps you could spare a star? ‚ú®üíªüêç

What can you expect from me? Well, here's a sneak peek:

- üì± I've got a hotline that's always buzzing. Feel free to reach out.
- üí™ I've never met a challenge I didn't like. Coding isn't just my job, it's my passion and I love pushing boundaries.
- üìö Lifelong learner? You bet! I'm always looking for smarter, cleaner, and more efficient ways to get things done.
